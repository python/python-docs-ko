"Because pseudo-terminal handling is highly platform dependent, there is "
"code to do it only for Linux. (The Linux code is supposed to work on "

"Fork. Connect the child's controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal. "
"Return value is ``(pid, fd)``. Note that the child  gets *pid* 0, and the"
" *fd* is *invalid*. The parent's return value is the *pid* of the child, "
"and *fd* is a file descriptor connected to the child's controlling "
"terminal (and also to the child's standard input and output)."

"Open a new pseudo-terminal pair, using :func:`os.openpty` if possible, or"

"respectively."
