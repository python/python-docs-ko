"The :mod:`sndhdr` provides utility functions which attempt to determine "
"the type of sound data which is in a file.  When these functions are able"
" to determine what type of sound data is stored in a file, they return a "
":func:`~collections.namedtuple`, containing five attributes: "
"(``filetype``, ``framerate``, ``nchannels``, ``nframes``, ``sampwidth``)."
" The value for *type* indicates the data type and will be one of the "
"strings ``'aifc'``, ``'aiff'``, ``'au'``, ``'hcom'``, ``'sndr'``, "
"``'sndt'``, ``'voc'``, ``'wav'``, ``'8svx'``, ``'sb'``, ``'ub'``, or "
"``'ul'``.  The *sampling_rate* will be either the actual value or ``0`` "
"if unknown or difficult to decode.  Similarly, *channels* will be either "
"the number of channels or ``0`` if it cannot be determined or if the "
"value is difficult to decode.  The value for *frames* will be either the "
"number of frames or ``-1``.  The last item in the tuple, "
"*bits_per_sample*, will either be the sample size in bits or ``'A'`` for "
"A-LAW or ``'U'`` for u-LAW."
