"This module provides constants which represent the numeric values of "
"internal nodes of the parse tree.  Unlike most Python constants, these "
"use lower-case names.  Refer to the file :file:`Grammar/Grammar` in the "
"Python distribution for the definitions of the names in the context of "
"the language grammar.  The specific numeric values which the names map to"
" may change between Python versions."
