#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Introduction"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "A CGI script is invoked by an "
#~ "HTTP server, usually to process user "
#~ "input submitted through an HTML "
#~ "``<FORM>`` or ``<ISINDEX>`` element."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Most often, CGI scripts live in "
#~ "the server's special :file:`cgi-bin` "
#~ "directory. The HTTP server places all"
#~ " sorts of information about the "
#~ "request (such as the client's hostname,"
#~ " the requested URL, the query string,"
#~ " and lots of other goodies) in "
#~ "the script's shell environment, executes "
#~ "the script, and sends the script's "
#~ "output back to the client."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The script's input is connected to "
#~ "the client too, and sometimes the "
#~ "form data is read this way; at "
#~ "other times the form data is "
#~ "passed via the \"query string\" part "
#~ "of the URL.  This module is "
#~ "intended to take care of the "
#~ "different cases and provide a simpler"
#~ " interface to the Python script.  It"
#~ " also provides a number of utilities"
#~ " that help in debugging scripts, and"
#~ " the latest addition is support for"
#~ " file uploads from a form (if "
#~ "your browser supports it)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The output of a CGI script should"
#~ " consist of two sections, separated "
#~ "by a blank line.  The first "
#~ "section contains a number of headers,"
#~ " telling the client what kind of "
#~ "data is following.  Python code to "
#~ "generate a minimal header section looks"
#~ " like this::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The second section is usually HTML, "
#~ "which allows the client software to "
#~ "display nicely formatted text with "
#~ "header, in-line images, etc. Here's "
#~ "Python code that prints a simple "
#~ "piece of HTML::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Using the cgi module"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Begin by writing ``import cgi``."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "When you write a new script, consider adding these lines::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This activates a special exception "
#~ "handler that will display detailed "
#~ "reports in the Web browser if any"
#~ " errors occur.  If you'd rather not"
#~ " show the guts of your program "
#~ "to users of your script, you can"
#~ " have the reports saved to files "
#~ "instead, with code like this::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "It's very helpful to use this "
#~ "feature during script development. The "
#~ "reports produced by :mod:`cgitb` provide "
#~ "information that can save you a "
#~ "lot of time in tracking down bugs."
#~ "  You can always remove the ``cgitb``"
#~ " line later when you have tested "
#~ "your script and are confident that "
#~ "it works correctly."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "To get at submitted form data, use"
#~ " the :class:`FieldStorage` class. If the"
#~ " form contains non-ASCII characters, "
#~ "use the *encoding* keyword parameter set"
#~ " to the value of the encoding "
#~ "defined for the document. It is "
#~ "usually contained in the META tag "
#~ "in the HEAD section of the HTML"
#~ " document or by the :mailheader"
#~ ":`Content-Type` header).  This reads the"
#~ " form contents from the standard "
#~ "input or the environment (depending on"
#~ " the value of various environment "
#~ "variables set according to the CGI "
#~ "standard).  Since it may consume "
#~ "standard input, it should be "
#~ "instantiated only once."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The :class:`FieldStorage` instance can be "
#~ "indexed like a Python dictionary. It "
#~ "allows membership testing with the "
#~ ":keyword:`in` operator, and also supports "
#~ "the standard dictionary method "
#~ ":meth:`~dict.keys` and the built-in "
#~ "function :func:`len`.  Form fields containing"
#~ " empty strings are ignored and do "
#~ "not appear in the dictionary; to "
#~ "keep such values, provide a true "
#~ "value for the optional *keep_blank_values* "
#~ "keyword parameter when creating the "
#~ ":class:`FieldStorage` instance."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "For instance, the following code (which"
#~ " assumes that the :mailheader:`Content-"
#~ "Type` header and blank line have "
#~ "already been printed) checks that the"
#~ " fields ``name`` and ``addr`` are "
#~ "both set to a non-empty string::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Here the fields, accessed through "
#~ "``form[key]``, are themselves instances of "
#~ ":class:`FieldStorage` (or :class:`MiniFieldStorage`, "
#~ "depending on the form encoding). The "
#~ ":attr:`~FieldStorage.value` attribute of the "
#~ "instance yields the string value of "
#~ "the field.  The :meth:`~FieldStorage.getvalue` "
#~ "method returns this string value "
#~ "directly; it also accepts an optional"
#~ " second argument as a default to "
#~ "return if the requested key is not"
#~ " present."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If the submitted form data contains "
#~ "more than one field with the same"
#~ " name, the object retrieved by "
#~ "``form[key]`` is not a :class:`FieldStorage`"
#~ " or :class:`MiniFieldStorage` instance but "
#~ "a list of such instances.  Similarly,"
#~ " in this situation, ``form.getvalue(key)`` "
#~ "would return a list of strings. If"
#~ " you expect this possibility (when "
#~ "your HTML form contains multiple fields"
#~ " with the same name), use the "
#~ ":meth:`~FieldStorage.getlist` method, which always"
#~ " returns a list of values (so "
#~ "that you do not need to "
#~ "special-case the single item case).  "
#~ "For example, this code concatenates any"
#~ " number of username fields, separated "
#~ "by commas::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If a field represents an uploaded "
#~ "file, accessing the value via the "
#~ ":attr:`~FieldStorage.value` attribute or the "
#~ ":meth:`~FieldStorage.getvalue` method reads the "
#~ "entire file in memory as bytes.  "
#~ "This may not be what you want."
#~ "  You can test for an uploaded "
#~ "file by testing either the "
#~ ":attr:`~FieldStorage.filename` attribute or the "
#~ ":attr:`~FieldStorage.file` attribute.  You can "
#~ "then read the data from the "
#~ ":attr:`!file` attribute before it is "
#~ "automatically closed as part of the "
#~ "garbage collection of the "
#~ ":class:`FieldStorage` instance (the "
#~ ":func:`~io.RawIOBase.read` and :func:`~io.IOBase.readline`"
#~ " methods will return bytes)::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":class:`FieldStorage` objects also support "
#~ "being used in a :keyword:`with` "
#~ "statement, which will automatically close "
#~ "them when done."

#~ "If an error is encountered when "
#~ "obtaining the contents of an uploaded"
#~ " file (for example, when the user "
#~ "interrupts the form submission by "
#~ "clicking on a Back or Cancel "
#~ "button) the :attr:`~FieldStorage.done` attribute "
#~ "of the object for the field will"
#~ " be set to the value -1."

#~ "The file upload draft standard "
#~ "entertains the possibility of uploading "
#~ "multiple files from one field (using "
#~ "a recursive :mimetype:`multipart/\\*` encoding). "
#~ "When this occurs, the item will be"
#~ " a dictionary-like :class:`FieldStorage` "
#~ "item. This can be determined by "
#~ "testing its :attr:`!type` attribute, which "
#~ "should be :mimetype:`multipart/form-data` (or"
#~ " perhaps another MIME type matching "
#~ ":mimetype:`multipart/\\*`).  In this case, it"
#~ " can be iterated over recursively "
#~ "just like the top-level form "
#~ "object."

#~ "When a form is submitted in the"
#~ " \"old\" format (as the query string"
#~ " or as a single data part of"
#~ " type :mimetype:`application/x-www-form-"

#~ " instances of the class "
#~ ":class:`MiniFieldStorage`.  In this case, the"

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The previous section explains how to "
#~ "read CGI form data using the "
#~ ":class:`FieldStorage` class.  This section "
#~ "describes a higher level interface which"
#~ " was added to this class to "
#~ "allow one to do it in a more"
#~ " readable and intuitive way.  The "
#~ "interface doesn't make the techniques "
#~ "described in previous sections obsolete "
#~ "--- they are still useful to "
#~ "process file uploads efficiently, for "
#~ "example."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The interface consists of two simple "
#~ "methods. Using the methods you can "
#~ "process form data in a generic "
#~ "way, without the need to worry "
#~ "whether only one or more values "
#~ "were posted under one name."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "In the previous section, you learned "
#~ "to write following code anytime you "
#~ "expected a user to post more than"
#~ " one value under one name::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This situation is common for example "
#~ "when a form contains a group of"
#~ " multiple checkboxes with the same "
#~ "name::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "In most situations, however, there's "
#~ "only one form control with a "
#~ "particular name in a form and then"
#~ " you expect and need only one "
#~ "value associated with this name.  So "
#~ "you write a script containing for "
#~ "example this code::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The problem with the code is that"
#~ " you should never expect that a "
#~ "client will provide valid input to "
#~ "your scripts.  For example, if a "
#~ "curious user appends another ``user=foo`` "
#~ "pair to the query string, then the"
#~ " script would crash, because in this"
#~ " situation the ``getvalue(\"user\")`` method "
#~ "call returns a list instead of a"
#~ " string.  Calling the :meth:`~str.upper` "
#~ "method on a list is not valid "
#~ "(since lists do not have a method"
#~ " of this name) and results in "
#~ "an :exc:`AttributeError` exception."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Therefore, the appropriate way to read"
#~ " form data values was to always "
#~ "use the code which checks whether "
#~ "the obtained value is a single "
#~ "value or a list of values.  That's"
#~ " annoying and leads to less readable"
#~ " scripts."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "A more convenient approach is to "
#~ "use the methods :meth:`~FieldStorage.getfirst` "
#~ "and :meth:`~FieldStorage.getlist` provided by "
#~ "this higher level interface."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This method always returns only one "
#~ "value associated with form field *name*."
#~ " The method returns only the first"
#~ " value in case that more values "
#~ "were posted under such name.  Please "
#~ "note that the order in which the"
#~ " values are received may vary from"
#~ " browser to browser and should not"
#~ " be counted on. [#]_  If no "
#~ "such form field or value exists "
#~ "then the method returns the value "
#~ "specified by the optional parameter "
#~ "*default*.  This parameter defaults to "
#~ "``None`` if not specified."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This method always returns a list "
#~ "of values associated with form field "
#~ "*name*. The method returns an empty "
#~ "list if no such form field or "
#~ "value exists for *name*.  It returns "
#~ "a list consisting of one item if"
