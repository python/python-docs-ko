#~ "There are only two ways to have"
#~ " a program on a single processor "
#~ "do  \"more than one thing at a "
#~ "time.\" Multi-threaded programming is "
#~ "the  simplest and most popular way "
#~ "to do it, but there is another "

#~ " have nearly all the advantages of"
#~ "  multi-threading, without actually using"
#~ " multiple threads.  It's really  only "
#~ "practical if your program is largely "
#~ "I/O bound.  If your program is "

#~ "scheduled threads are probably what you"

#~ "doing other work while your I/O is"
#~ " taking place in the \"background.\"  "
#~ "Although this strategy can seem strange"
#~ " and complex, especially at first, it"
#~ " is in many ways easier to "
#~ "understand and control than multi-"
#~ "threaded programming.  The :mod:`asyncore` "
#~ "module solves many of the difficult "
#~ "problems for you, making the task "
#~ "of building sophisticated high-performance "
#~ "network servers and clients a snap.  "
#~ "For \"conversational\" applications and "

#~ " is invaluable."

#~ "The basic idea behind both modules "
#~ "is to create one or more network"
#~ " *channels*, instances of class "
#~ ":class:`asyncore.dispatcher` and "
#~ ":class:`asynchat.async_chat`.  Creating the channels"
#~ " adds them to a global map, "

#~ "you do not provide it with your"
#~ " own *map*."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Once the initial channel(s) is(are) "
#~ "created, calling the :func:`loop` function "
#~ "activates channel service, which continues "

#~ "map during asynchronous service) is "
#~ "closed."

#~ "Enter a polling loop that terminates "
#~ "after count passes or all open "
#~ "channels have been closed.  All "
#~ "arguments are optional.  The *count* "
#~ "parameter defaults to ``None``, resulting "
#~ "in the loop terminating only when "
#~ "all channels have been closed.  The "
#~ "*timeout* argument sets the timeout "
#~ "parameter for the appropriate "
#~ ":func:`~select.select` or :func:`~select.poll` call,"
#~ " measured in seconds; the default is"
#~ " 30 seconds.  The *use_poll* parameter, "

#~ "The *map* parameter is a dictionary "

#~ "The :class:`dispatcher` class is a thin"

#~ "The firing of low-level events at"

#~ " we have asked for a socket to"
#~ " connect to another host, we know "
