"The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the "
"concept of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both "
"simple string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any "

"The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the "
":rfc:`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered"
" that MSIE 3.0x doesn't follow the character rules outlined in those "
"specs and also many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing"
" rules when comes to Cookie handling.  As a result, the parsing rules "
"used are a bit less strict."
