"The functions in this chapter interact with Python objects regardless of "
"their type, or with wide classes of object types (e.g. all numerical "

"do not apply, they will raise a Python exception."

"It is not possible to use these functions on objects that are not "
"properly initialized, such as a list object that has been created by "
":c:func:`PyList_New`, but whose items have not been set to some non-\\ "
"``NULL`` value yet."
