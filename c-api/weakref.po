"Python supports *weak references* as first-class objects.  There are two "
"specific object types which directly implement weak references.  The "
"first is a simple reference object, and the second acts as a proxy for "
"the original object as much as it can."

"Return a weak reference object for the object *ob*.  This will always "
"return a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object; an "
"existing reference object may be returned.  The second parameter, "
"*callback*, can be a callable object that receives notification when *ob*"
" is garbage collected; it should accept a single parameter, which will be"
" the weak reference object itself. *callback* may also be ``None`` or "
"*NULL*.  If *ob* is not a weakly-referencable object, or if *callback* is"
" not callable, ``None``, or *NULL*, this will return *NULL* and raise "
":exc:`TypeError`."
